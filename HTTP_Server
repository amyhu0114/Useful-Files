/*This simple JAVA program demonstrates how to create a HTTP Server using JAVA. After completing the program, you can access the server you just created using Internet Explorer, Firefox, etc. 
First, import the following (ServerSocket and Socket) in preparation for the server
Instantiate a ServerSocket so you can create a server that accept requests. Print out some instructions to guide your users through the access process
Make an infinite while loop so that the server runs for the durations that the program is running
Accepts any incoming connections through the accept method
The server will response (a.k.a. display response on screen) through the write() method with the a string (httpResponse) you've created.
Reminder: The server will only allow one connection per time - remember to close the operating window after each run*/

import java.io.IOException; 
import java.net.ServerSocket; 
import java.net.Socket; 
public class HTTP_Server { 
	public static void main(String args[]) throws IOException { 
		ServerSocket server = new ServerSocket(8080); 
		System.out.println("Go to http://localhost:8080 in your browser"); 
		while (true) { 
			try (Socket socket = server.accept()) { 
			String httpResponse = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n" + "Congrats!!! You've made your first http server!!! =)"; 
			socket.getOutputStream().write(httpResponse.getBytes("UTF-8")); 
				} 
			}
